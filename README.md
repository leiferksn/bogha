It's an android app that lets you store and track your 3D archery competitive sessions scores.

The need for this app arose after a couple of games, during which me and my archery rivals had to keep score on paper and couple of days after that misplaced them never to find them again or be able to keep track on how we perform. What really bothered me as well was that there's a great great iOS [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/archery-scoresheets/id1308246428) for that but not a good one for Android, imo. The existing ones are either to cluttered or have too many options, which made the usage tedious. My goal is to develop a simple app for 3D archery which is based on a simple scoring templates, sending out reports and maybe at first and then later with the option to show some kind of statistics and how my performance develops in time.

Further step in the development could be to either use the same concept for other sports that require similar scoring or develop another app just for golfing.
